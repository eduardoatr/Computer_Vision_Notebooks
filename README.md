# Computer Vision Notebooks

> ⚠️ All the resources required to run the notebooks are located inside their folders.

This repository contains multiple **Jupyter Notebooks** implementing computer vision tasks, including:

- [**_Camera Calibration:_**](camera_calibration/camera_calibration.ipynb) Implementation of a camera calibration algorithm and its comparison against the **Octave** calibration tool.
- [**_CNNs vs Bag of Features:_**](cnn_versus_bof/cnn_versus_bof.ipynb) Comparison between object classification by employing convolutional neural networks and the bag of features method.
- [**_Harris Detector:_**](harris_detector/harris_detector.ipynb) Implementation of the Harris Corner Detector and comparison against the **OpenCV** library.
- [**_Photo Mosaic:_**](mosaic/photo_mosaic.ipynb) Implementation of a photo mosaic algorithm and comparison against a professional tool using multiple keypoint detectors, descriptors and blending methods.
